Hi, My name is Syed Omer Gilani. I am an aspiring educator, avid reader, curious learner, keen programmer, ___ writer, and caring member of a wonderful family. I function as a tenured associate professor at a leading university in Pakistan in my day job. Outside my day job, I mostly read non-fiction, spend quality time with family and friends, and do programming (of *mind and computer both!*)

I started this blog to share what I have learned over the years and what I am learning now
