            "content": "Activating project environment . Every julia project can has it&#39;s own environment just as python. In jupyter notebook, the environment can be activated by importing Pkg - a julia package management system . First, let&#39;s ensure we are in correct directory. . basename(pwd()) # the last part of the directory. . &#34;Basic Image Processing&#34; . This seems correct as I am hosting this code file in Basic Image Processing Folder. Now let&#39;s go ahead with activating the environment. . using Pkg Pkg.activate(&quot;.&quot;) . Activating project at `~/website/Julia_Projects/Basic Image Processing` . Now let&#39;s add required packages Images and TestImages to this environment . Pkg.add([&quot;Images&quot;,&quot;TestImages&quot;]); # add the Images package . Updating registry at `~/.julia/registries/General.toml` Resolving package versions... Installed StringDistances ─ v0.11.2 Installed TestImages ────── v1.6.2 Updating `~/website/Julia_Projects/Basic Image Processing/Project.toml` [5e47fb64] + TestImages v1.6.2 Updating `~/website/Julia_Projects/Basic Image Processing/Manifest.toml` [88034a9c] + StringDistances v0.11.2 [5e47fb64] + TestImages v1.6.2 Precompiling project... ✓ StringDistances ✓ TestImages 2 dependencies successfully precompiled in 3 seconds (117 already precompiled) . Importing Libraries . After setting up the environment, we now move to importing libraries. . using Images, TestImages . Now let&#39;s load test image lighthouse.png. The package TestImages conveniently provides us with many legacy test images from image processing domain. . img = testimage(&quot;lighthouse.png&quot;) . In jupyter notebook, images will be displayed by default after loading. Now to see the image dimensions, let&#39;s use size function . size(img) . (512, 768) . The above output shows that light house image has a width of 768 pixels and a height of height of 512 pixels. Alternatively, we can also state that image has 512 rows and 768 columns. . Important :Following notation are analogous to each other. We frequently reference them in text interchangeably. . Tip: image(height,width) $ rightarrow$ image(rows,cols) $ rightarrow$ image(1st dimension, 2nd dimension) $ rightarrow$ image(y,x) $ rightarrow$ image (argument 1, argument 2) . Cropping of Image: . Images are treated as matrices. By providing indices, we can extract or display portion of the image. . Let&#39;s consider a problem of cropping the light house from above picture. To do so, we need to provide correct indices range in image coordinate system . Important: In image coordinate system, origin is top-left corner. To provide a range in rows and column we use following notation . rows[start index : stop index, start index : stop index] . The : sign is showing the continuity, so for example 10:15 mean index value 10,11,12,13,14,15 . To extract the light house from above image, we provide the $y$/height (50:350) and $x$/width (300:400) coordinates . img[50:350,300:400] # cropping lighthouse image . Resizing image . We can also resize image easily. We simply supply ratio value. . A ratio value of 0.5 means half of original size (512 x 0.5, 768 x 0.5) | A ratio value of 2 means double of original size (512 x 2, 768 x 2) | . img_rs = imresize(img, ratio = 0.5) size(img_rs) . (256, 384) . Rotation of image . We can also rotate image . 90 $ text{ textdegree}$ anti-clockwise rotation: $- pi$/2 | 45 $ text{ textdegree}$ anti-clockwise rotation: $- pi$/4 | 90 $ text{ textdegree}$ clockwise rotation: $ pi$/2 | 45 $ text{ textdegree}$ clockwise rotation: $ pi$/4 | . imrotate(img,-π/2) . . Tip: In julia pi + tab translates to $ pi$ . Numeric value of pixel. . If we want to see the numeric value of pixel (value of R,G,B) then we need to add a third argument as :. . Note: With only two arguments, the image is displayed and numeric values are not displayed (see Cropping of Image). . img[1:5,1:5,:] # adding third argument . 5×5×1 Array{RGB{N0f8}, 3}: [:, :, 1] = RGB(0.361, 0.486, 0.6) … RGB(0.369, 0.506, 0.616) RGB(0.361, 0.486, 0.6) RGB(0.361, 0.498, 0.608) RGB(0.376, 0.514, 0.624) RGB(0.369, 0.506, 0.616) RGB(0.365, 0.498, 0.62) RGB(0.353, 0.49, 0.608) RGB(0.365, 0.498, 0.627) RGB(0.365, 0.498, 0.62) . If we need to only inspect single pixel, we can use color channel names as follows . red(img[1,1]), green(img[1,1]), blue(img[1,1]) . (0.361N0f8, 0.486N0f8, 0.6N0f8) . Compatibility . .

            "content": "Mounting Google Drive . Mounting Google Drive. This is boilerplate code that will mount your Google Drive into you colab space and you will have access to all the files and folders in your Google Drive. . from google.colab import drive drive.mount(&#39;/content/drive/&#39;) . Mounted at /content/drive/ . Next I move into current directory. Since my code is hosted in Colab Notebooks (1) directory so I&#39;ll apply cd (change directory) to move into this folder. . cd &#39;drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks (1)/&#39; . The above directory is where all my google colab codes reside. In addition to the code, I also have dataset folder that will contain different datasets of images, text, tables etc. The idea is to have a consistent directroy structure across all my projects i.e., codes in parent folder and datasets in subfolder. . Importing Libraries . import cv2 as cv from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow # to show images in colab. . Basic Image Display . img = cv.imread(&#39;Dataset/Images/python_logo.png&#39;) # reading image . cv2_imshow(img) # displaying image . The origin of Image is always top-left conrner as oppose to origin of graph (which is bottom left corner). . Images can be visualized/imagined as matrices. In 2D matrices we have rows and columns. We can access these rows and columns by specifying the start and stop numeric values [row_start:row_stop, col_start:col_stop]. . In the following example, we want to display first 500 rows and 500 columns of the image. . cv2_imshow(img[0:500, 0:500]) # showing only top left corner . We can also override the pixel values by assinging any numeric value between 0-255. In following code example . we first create a copy original image | overide the pixel values of first 500 rows and 500 columns by assigning and RGB colour value ( (b,g,r) with range of (0-255,0-255,0-255 ) for each color component. Please note that OpenCV color model is reversed (BGR) | img2 = img.copy() img2[0:500,0:500] = (0,0,255) cv2_imshow(cv.hconcat((img, img2))) # horizontally concatinating the images to see the differences . As seen the original image left is not changed and only copy (on the right) is changed. . We can also show a partial image either by . by cropping image | by showing portion of the image | . img2 = img[0:500,0:500].copy() # cropping image cv2_imshow(cv.hconcat((img[0:500,0:500],img2))) . As seen the left image is partial shown, while the right image is fully shown (albiet it was cropped when copying from original image). .",
